## üîê Security Best Practices

### For Developers Using Nitrokit

1. **Environment Variables**

    ```bash
    # ‚úÖ Use .env.local for sensitive data
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your-secret-key
    DATABASE_URL=your-database-url

    # ‚úÖ Add to .gitignore
    .env.local
    .env
    ```

2. **API Keys Management**

    - Never commit API keys to version control
    - Use environment-specific configurations
    - Rotate keys regularly
    - Use least-privilege access

3. **Dependencies**

    ```bash
    # Regular security audits
    yarn audit

    # Update dependencies
    yarn upgrade-interactive
    ```

### For Production Deployments

1. **HTTPS Only**

    - Always use HTTPS in production
    - Enable HSTS headers
    - Use secure cookies

2. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**

    ```typescript
    // next.config.js
    const securityHeaders = [
        {
            key: 'Content-Security-Policy',
            value: "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval';",
        },
    ];
    ```

3. **Authentication & Authorization**
    - Implement proper session management
    - Use secure authentication providers
    - Validate all user inputs
